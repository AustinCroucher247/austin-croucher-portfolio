Welcome to my portfolio website! This unique and engaging platform showcases my work as a web developer and designer. The website offers two distinct viewing experiences: a standard view and an interactive game-like mode. Users can choose their preferred experience upon arrival.

**Standard View**

The standard view provides a clean, professional, and responsive layout that highlights my projects, skills, and background. Visitors can easily navigate through the various sections to learn more about my work and get in touch with me.

**Interactive Game Mode**

The interactive game mode offers a fun and engaging way to explore my portfolio. Users can control a character that walks around a virtual environment, interacting with various elements to learn about my projects. This game-like experience demonstrates my creativity and ability to develop unique, interactive user experiences.
